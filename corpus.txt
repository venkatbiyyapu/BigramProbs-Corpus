actus primus .
scoena prima .
enter flauius , murellus , and certaine commoners ouer the stage .
flauius .
hence : home you idle creatures , get you home : is this a holiday ?
what , know you not ( being mechanicall ) you ought not walke vpon a labouring day , without the signe of your profession ?
speake , what trade art thou ?
car .
why sir , a carpenter
mur .
where is thy leather apron , and thy rule ?
what dost thou with thy best apparrell on ?
you sir , what trade are you ?
cobl .
truely sir , in respect of a fine workman , i am but as you would say , a cobler
mur .
but what trade art thou ?
answer me directly
cob .
a trade sir , that i hope i may vse , with a safe conscience , which is indeed sir , a mender of bad soules
fla . what trade thou knaue ?
thou naughty knaue , what trade ?
cobl .
nay i beseech you sir , be not out with me : yet if you be out sir , i can mend you
mur .
what mean ' st thou by that ?
mend mee , thou sawcy fellow ?
cob .
why sir , cobble you
fla . thou art a cobler , art thou ?
cob .
truly sir , all that i liue by , is with the aule : i meddle with no tradesmans matters , nor womens matters ; but withal i am indeed sir , a surgeon to old shooes : when they are in great danger , i recouer them .
as proper men as euer trod vpon neats leather , haue gone vpon my handy - worke
fla .
but wherefore art not in thy shop to day ?
why do ' st thou leade these men about the streets ?
cob .
truly sir , to weare out their shooes , to get my selfe into more worke .
but indeede sir , we make holyday to see caesar , and to reioyce in his triumph
mur .
wherefore reioyce ?
what conquest brings he home ?
what tributaries follow him to rome , to grace in captiue bonds his chariot wheeles ?
you blockes , you stones , you worse then senslesse things : o you hard hearts , you cruell men of rome , knew you not pompey many a time and oft ?
haue you climb ' d vp to walles and battlements , to towres and windowes ?
yea , to chimney tops , your infants in your armes , and there haue sate the liue - long day , with patient expectation , to see great pompey passe the streets of rome : and when you saw his chariot but appeare , haue you not made an vniuersall shout , that tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes to heare the replication of your sounds , made in her concaue shores ?
and do you now put on your best attyre ?
and do you now cull out a holyday ?
and do you now strew flowers in his way , that comes in triumph ouer pompeyes blood ?
be gone , runne to your houses , fall vpon your knees , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude
fla . go , go , good countrymen , and for this fault assemble all the poore men of your sort ; draw them to tyber bankes , and weepe your teares into the channell , till the lowest streame do kisse the most exalted shores of all .
exeunt .
all the commoners .
see where their basest mettle be not mou ' d , they vanish tongue - tyed in their guiltinesse : go you downe that way towards the capitoll , this way will i : disrobe the images , if you do finde them deckt with ceremonies
mur .
may we do so ?
you know it is the feast of lupercall
fla .
it is no matter , let no images be hung with caesars trophees : ile about , and driue away the vulgar from the streets ; so do you too , where you perceiue them thicke .
these growing feathers , pluckt from caesars wing , will make him flye an ordinary pitch , who else would soare aboue the view of men , and keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse .
exeunt .
enter caesar , antony for the course , calphurnia , portia , decius , cicero , brutus , cassius , caska , a soothsayer : after them murellus and flauius .
caes .

cask .
peace ho , caesar speakes
caes .
calphurnia
calp .
heere my lord
caes .
stand you directly in antonio ' s way , when he doth run his course .
antonio
ant .
cÃ¦sar , my lord
caes .
forget not in your speed antonio , to touch calphurnia : for our elders say , the barren touched in this holy chace , shake off their sterrile curse
ant .
i shall remember , when caesar sayes , do this ; it is perform ' d
caes .
set on , and leaue no ceremony out
sooth .
caesar
caes .
ha ?
who calles ?
cask .
bid euery noyse be still : peace yet againe
caes .
who is it in the presse , that calles on me ?
i heare a tongue shriller then all the musicke cry , caesar : speake , caesar is turn ' d to heare
sooth .
beware the ides of march
caes .
what man is that ?
br .
a sooth - sayer bids you beware the ides of march caes .
set him before me , let me see his face
cassi .
fellow , come from the throng , look vpon caesar
caes .
what sayst thou to me now ?
speak once againe , sooth .
beware the ides of march
caes .
he is a dreamer , let vs leaue him : passe .
sennet
exeunt .
manet brut .
& cass .
cassi .
will you go see the order of the course ?
brut .
not i
cassi .
i pray you do
brut .
i am not gamesom : i do lacke some part of that quicke spirit that is in antony : let me not hinder cassius your desires ; ile leaue you
cassi .
brutus , i do obserue you now of late : i haue not from your eyes , that gentlenesse and shew of loue , as i was wont to haue : you beare too stubborne , and too strange a hand ouer your friend , that loues you
bru .
cassius , be not deceiu ' d : if i haue veyl ' d my looke , i turne the trouble of my countenance meerely vpon my selfe .
vexed i am of late , with passions of some difference , conceptions onely proper to my selfe , which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my behauiours : but let not therefore my good friends be greeu ' d ( among which number cassius be you one ) nor construe any further my neglect , then that poore brutus with himselfe at warre , forgets the shewes of loue to other men
cassi .
then brutus , i haue much mistook your passion , by meanes whereof , this brest of mine hath buried thoughts of great value , worthy cogitations .
tell me good brutus , can you see your face ?
brutus .
no cassius : for the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection , by some other things
cassius .
' tis iust , and it is very much lamented brutus , that you haue no such mirrors , as will turne your hidden worthinesse into your eye , that you might see your shadow : i haue heard , where many of the best respect in rome , ( except immortall caesar ) speaking of brutus , and groaning vnderneath this ages yoake , haue wish ' d , that noble brutus had his eyes
bru .
into what dangers , would you leade me cassius ?
that you would haue me seeke into my selfe , for that which is not in me ?
cas .
therefore good brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : and since you know , you cannot see your selfe so well as by reflection ; i your glasse , will modestly discouer to your selfe that of your selfe , which you yet know not of .
and be not iealous on me , gentle brutus : were i a common laughter , or did vse to stale with ordinary oathes my loue to euery new protester : if you know , that i do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , and after scandall them : or if you know , that i professe my selfe in banquetting to all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
flourish , and shout .
bru .
what meanes this showting ?
i do feare , the people choose caesar for their king
cassi .
i , do you feare it ?
then must i thinke you would not haue it so
bru .
i would not cassius , yet i loue him well : but wherefore do you hold me heere so long ?
what is it , that you would impart to me ?
if it be ought toward the generall good , set honor in one eye , and death i ' th other , and i will looke on both indifferently : for let the gods so speed mee , as i loue the name of honor , more then i feare death
cassi .
i know that vertue to be in you brutus , as well as i do know your outward fauour .
well , honor is the subiect of my story : i cannot tell , what you and other men thinke of this life : but for my single selfe , i had as liefe not be , as liue to be in awe of such a thing , as i my selfe .
i was borne free as caesar , so were you , we both haue fed as well , and we can both endure the winters cold , as well as hee .
for once , vpon a rawe and gustie day , the troubled tyber , chafing with her shores , caesar saide to me , dar ' st thou cassius now leape in with me into this angry flood , and swim to yonder point ?
vpon the word , accoutred as i was , i plunged in , and bad him follow : so indeed he did .
the torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it with lusty sinewes , throwing it aside , and stemming it with hearts of controuersie .
but ere we could arriue the point propos ' d , caesar cride , helpe me cassius , or i sinke .
i ( as aeneas , our great ancestor , did from the flames of troy , vpon his shoulder the old anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of tyber did i the tyred caesar : and this man , is now become a god , and cassius is a wretched creature , and must bend his body , if caesar carelesly but nod on him .
he had a feauer when he was in spaine , and when the fit was on him , i did marke how he did shake : tis true , this god did shake , his coward lippes did from their colour flye , and that same eye , whose bend doth awe the world , did loose his lustre : i did heare him grone : i , and that tongue of his , that bad the romans marke him , and write his speeches in their bookes , alas , it cried , giue me some drinke titinius , as a sicke girle : ye gods , it doth amaze me , a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the maiesticke world , and beare the palme alone .
shout .
flourish .
bru .
another generall shout ?
i do beleeue , that these applauses are for some new honors , that are heap ' d on caesar
cassi .
why man , he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus , and we petty men walke vnder his huge legges , and peepe about to finde our selues dishonourable graues .
men at sometime , are masters of their fates .
the fault ( deere brutus ) is not in our starres , but in our selues , that we are vnderlings .
brutus and caesar : what should be in that caesar ?
why should that name be sounded more then yours write them together : yours , is as faire a name : sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : weigh them , it is as heauy : coniure with ' em , brutus will start a spirit as soone as caesar .
now in the names of all the gods at once , vpon what meate doth this our caesar feede , that he is growne so great ?
age , thou art sham ' d .
rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods .
when went there by an age , since the great flood , but it was fam ' d with more then with one man ?
when could they say ( till now ) that talk ' d of rome , that her wide walkes incompast but one man ?
now is it rome indeed , and roome enough when there is in it but one onely man .
o !
you and i , haue heard our fathers say , there was a brutus once , that would haue brook ' d th ' eternall diuell to keepe his state in rome , as easily as a king
bru .
that you do loue me , i am nothing iealous : what you would worke me too , i haue some ayme : how i haue thought of this , and of these times i shall recount heereafter .
for this present , i would not so ( with loue i might intreat you ) be any further moou ' d : what you haue said , i will consider : what you haue to say i will with patience heare , and finde a time both meete to heare , and answer such high things .
till then , my noble friend , chew vpon this : brutus had rather be a villager , then to repute himselfe a sonne of rome vnder these hard conditions , as this time is like to lay vpon vs
cassi .
i am glad that my weake words haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from brutus , enter caesar and his traine .
bru .
the games are done , and caesar is returning
cassi .
as they passe by , plucke caska by the sleeue , and he will ( after his sowre fashion ) tell you what hath proceeded worthy note to day
bru .
i will do so : but looke you cassius , the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow , and all the rest , looke like a chidden traine ; calphurnia ' s cheeke is pale , and cicero lookes with such ferret , and such fiery eyes as we haue seene him in the capitoll being crost in conference , by some senators
cassi .
caska will tell vs what the matter is
caes antonio
ant .
caesar
caes let me haue men about me , that are fat , sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : yond cassius has a leane and hungry looke , he thinkes too much : such men are dangerous
ant .
feare him not caesar , he ' s not dangerous , he is a noble roman , and well giuen
caes would he were fatter ; but i feare him not : yet if my name were lyable to feare , i do not know the man i should auoyd so soone as that spare cassius .
he reades much , he is a great obseruer , and he lookes quite through the deeds of men .
he loues no playes , as thou dost antony : he heares no musicke ; seldome he smiles , and smiles in such a sort as if he mock ' d himselfe , and scorn ' d his spirit that could be mou ' d to smile at any thing .
such men as he , be neuer at hearts ease , whiles they behold a greater then themselues , and therefore are they very dangerous .
i rather tell thee what is to be fear ' d , then what i feare : for alwayes i am caesar .
come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , and tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him .
sennit .
exeunt .
caesar and his traine .
cask .
you pul ' d me by the cloake , would you speake with me ?
bru .
i caska , tell vs what hath chanc ' d to day that caesar lookes so sad
cask .
why you were with him , were you not ?
bru .
i should not then aske caska what had chanc ' d
cask .
why there was a crowne offer ' d him ; & being offer ' d him , he put it by with the backe of his hand thus , and then the people fell a shouting
bru .
what was the second noyse for ?
cask .
why for that too
cassi .
they shouted thrice : what was the last cry for ?
cask .
why for that too
bru .
was the crowne offer ' d him thrice ?
cask .
i marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest neighbors showted
cassi .
who offer ' d him the crowne ?
cask .
why antony
bru .
tell vs the manner of it , gentle caska
caska .
i can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : it was meere foolerie , i did not marke it .
i sawe marke antony offer him a crowne , yet ' twas not a crowne neyther , ' twas one of these coronets : and as i told you , hee put it by once : but for all that , to my thinking , he would faine haue had it .
then hee offered it to him againe : then hee put it by againe : but to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
and then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because caesar refus ' d the crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : and for mine owne part , i durst not laugh , for feare of opening my lippes , and receyuing the bad ayre
cassi .
but soft i pray you : what , did caesar swound ?
cask .
he fell downe in the market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse
brut .
' tis very like he hath the falling sicknesse
cassi .
no , caesar hath it not : but you , and i , and honest caska , we haue the falling sicknesse
cask .
i know not what you meane by that , but i am sure caesar fell downe .
if the tag - ragge people did not clap him , and hisse him , according as he pleas ' d , and displeas ' d them , as they vse to doe the players in the theatre , i am no true man
brut .
what said he , when he came vnto himselfe ?
cask .
marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common heard was glad he refus ' d the crowne , he pluckt me ope his doublet , and offer ' d them his throat to cut : and i had beene a man of any occupation , if i would not haue taken him at a word , i would i might goe to hell among the rogues , and so hee fell .
when he came to himselfe againe , hee said , if hee had done , or said any thing amisse , he desir ' d their worships to thinke it was his infirmitie .
three or foure wenches where i stood , cryed , alasse good soule , and forgaue him with all their hearts : but there ' s no heed to be taken of them ; if caesar had stab ' d their mothers , they would haue done no lesse
brut .
and after that , he came thus sad away
cask .
i
cassi .
did cicero say any thing ?
cask .
i , he spoke greeke
cassi .
to what effect ?
cask .
nay , and i tell you that , ile ne ' re looke you i ' th ' face againe .
but those that vnderstood him , smil ' d at one another , and shooke their heads : but for mine owne part , it was greeke to me .
i could tell you more newes too : murrellus and flauius , for pulling scarffes off caesars images , are put to silence .
fare you well .
there was more foolerie yet , if i could remember it
cassi .
will you suppe with me to night , caska ?
cask .
no , i am promis ' d forth
cassi .
will you dine with me to morrow ?
cask .
i , if i be aliue , and your minde hold , and your dinner worth the eating
cassi .
good , i will expect you
cask .
doe so : farewell both .
enter .
brut .
what a blunt fellow is this growne to be ?
he was quick mettle , when he went to schoole
cassi .
so is he now , in execution of any bold , or noble enterprize , how - euer he puts on this tardie forme : this rudenesse is a sawce to his good wit , which giues men stomacke to disgest his words with better appetite
brut .
and so it is : for this time i will leaue you : to morrow , if you please to speake with me , i will come home to you : or if you will , come home to me , and i will wait for you
cassi .
i will doe so : till then , thinke of the world .
exit brutus .
well brutus , thou art noble : yet i see , thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , that noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : for who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ?
caesar doth beare me hard , but he loues brutus .
if i were brutus now , and he were cassius , he should not humor me .
i will this night , in seuerall hands , in at his windowes throw , as if they came from seuerall citizens , writings , all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name : wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at .
and after this , let caesar seat him sure , for wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure .
enter .
thunder , and lightning .
enter caska , and cicero .
cic .
good euen , caska : brought you caesar home ?
why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ?
cask .
are not you mou ' d , when all the sway of earth shakes , like a thing vnfirme ?
o cicero , i haue seene tempests , when the scolding winds haue riu ' d the knottie oakes , and i haue seene th ' ambitious ocean swell , and rage , and foame , to be exalted with the threatning clouds : but neuer till to night , neuer till now , did i goe through a tempest - dropping - fire .
eyther there is a ciuill strife in heauen , or else the world , too sawcie with the gods , incenses them to send destruction
cic .
why , saw you any thing more wonderfull ?
cask .
a common slaue , you know him well by sight , held vp his left hand , which did flame and burne like twentie torches ioyn ' d ; and yet his hand , not sensible of fire , remain ' d vnscorch ' d .
besides , i ha ' not since put vp my sword , against the capitoll i met a lyon , who glaz ' d vpon me , and went surly by , without annoying me .
and there were drawne vpon a heape , a hundred gastly women , transformed with their feare , who swore , they saw men , all in fire , walke vp and downe the streetes .
and yesterday , the bird of night did sit , euen at noone - day , vpon the market place , howting , and shreeking .
when these prodigies doe so conioyntly meet , let not men say , these are their reasons , they are naturall : for i beleeue , they are portentous things vnto the clymate , that they point vpon
cic .
indeed , it is a strange disposed time : but men may construe things after their fashion , cleane from the purpose of the things themselues .
comes caesar to the capitoll to morrow ?
cask .
he doth : for he did bid antonio send word to you , he would be there to morrow
cic .
good - night then , caska : this disturbed skie is not to walke in
cask .
farewell cicero .
exit cicero .
enter cassius .
cassi .
who ' s there ?
cask .
a romane
cassi .
caska , by your voyce
cask .
your eare is good .
cassius , what night is this ?
cassi .
a very pleasing night to honest men
cask .
who euer knew the heauens menace so ?
cassi .
those that haue knowne the earth so full of faults .
for my part , i haue walk ' d about the streets , submitting me vnto the perillous night ; and thus vnbraced , caska , as you see , haue bar ' d my bosome to the thunder - stone : and when the crosse blew lightning seem ' d to open the brest of heauen , i did present my selfe euen in the ayme , and very flash of it
cask .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heauens ?
it is the part of men , to feare and tremble , when the most mightie gods , by tokens send such dreadfull heraulds , to astonish vs
cassi .
you are dull , caska : and those sparkes of life , that should be in a roman , you doe want , or else you vse not .
you looke pale , and gaze , and put on feare , and cast your selfe in wonder , to see the strange impatience of the heauens : but if you would consider the true cause , why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , why birds and beasts , from qualitie and kinde , why old men , fooles , and children calculate , why all these things change from their ordinance , their natures , and pre - formed faculties , to monstrous qualitie ; why you shall finde , that heauen hath infus ' d them with these spirits , to make them instruments of feare , and warning , vnto some monstrous state .
now could i ( caska ) name to thee a man , most like this dreadfull night , that thunders , lightens , opens graues , and roares , as doth the lyon in the capitoll : a man no mightier then thy selfe , or me , in personall action ; yet prodigious growne , and fearefull , as these strange eruptions are
cask .
' tis caesar that you meane : is it not , cassius ?
cassi .
let it be who it is : for romans now haue thewes , and limbes , like to their ancestors ; but woe the while , our fathers mindes are dead , and we are gouern ' d with our mothers spirits , our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs womanish
cask .
indeed , they say , the senators to morrow meane to establish caesar as a king : and he shall weare his crowne by sea , and land , in euery place , saue here in italy
cassi .
i know where i will weare this dagger then ; cassius from bondage will deliuer cassius : therein , yee gods , you make the weake most strong ; therein , yee gods , you tyrants doe defeat .
nor stonie tower , nor walls of beaten brasse , nor ayre - lesse dungeon , nor strong linkes of iron , can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : but life being wearie of these worldly barres , neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe .
if i know this , know all the world besides , that part of tyrannie that i doe beare , i can shake off at pleasure .
thunder still .
cask .
so can i : so euery bond - man in his owne hand beares the power to cancell his captiuitie
cassi .
and why should cÃ¦sar be a tyrant then ?
poore man , i know he would not be a wolfe , but that he sees the romans are but sheepe : he were no lyon , were not romans hindes .
those that with haste will make a mightie fire , begin it with weake strawes .
what trash is rome ?
what rubbish , and what offall ?
when it serues for the base matter , to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar .
but oh griefe , where hast thou led me ?
i ( perhaps ) speake this before a willing bond - man : then i know my answere must be made .
but i am arm ' d , and dangers are to me indifferent
cask .
you speake to caska , and to such a man , that is no flearing tell - tale .
hold , my hand : be factious for redresse of all these griefes , and i will set this foot of mine as farre , as who goes farthest
cassi .
there ' s a bargaine made .
now know you , caska , i haue mou ' d already some certaine of the noblest minded romans to vnder - goe , with me , an enterprize , of honorable dangerous consequence ; and i doe know by this , they stay for me in pompeyes porch : for now this fearefull night , there is no stirre , or walking in the streetes ; and the complexion of the element is fauors , like the worke we haue in hand , most bloodie , fierie , and most terrible .
enter cinna .
caska .
stand close a while , for heere comes one in haste
cassi .
' tis cinna , i doe know him by his gate , he is a friend .
cinna , where haste you so ?
cinna .
to finde out you : who ' s that , metellus cymber ?
cassi .
no , it is caska , one incorporate to our attempts .
am i not stay ' d for , cinna ?
cinna .
i am glad on ' t .
what a fearefull night is this ?
there ' s two or three of vs haue seene strange sights
cassi .
am i not stay ' d for ?
tell me
cinna .
yes , you are .
o cassius , if you could but winne the noble brutus to our party - cassi .
be you content .
good cinna , take this paper , and looke you lay it in the pretors chayre , where brutus may but finde it : and throw this in at his window ; set this vp with waxe vpon old brutus statue : all this done , repaire to pompeyes porch , where you shall finde vs . is decius brutus and trebonius there ?
cinna .
all , but metellus cymber , and hee ' s gone to seeke you at your house .
well , i will hie , and so bestow these papers as you bad me
cassi .
that done , repayre to pompeyes theater .
exit cinna .
come caska , you and i will yet , ere day , see brutus at his house : three parts of him is ours alreadie , and the man entire vpon the next encounter , yeelds him ours
cask .
o , he sits high in all the peoples hearts : and that which would appeare offence in vs , his countenance , like richest alchymie , will change to vertue , and to worthinesse
cassi .
him , and his worth , and our great need of him , you haue right well conceited : let vs goe , for it is after mid - night , and ere day , we will awake him , and be sure of him .
exeunt .
actus secundus .
enter brutus in his orchard .
brut .
what lucius , hoe ?
i cannot , by the progresse of the starres , giue guesse how neere to day - lucius , i say ?
i would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly .
when lucius , when ?
awake , i say : what lucius ?
enter lucius .
luc .
call ' d you , my lord ?
brut .
get me a tapor in my study , lucius : when it is lighted , come and call me here
luc .
i will , my lord .
enter .
brut .
it must be by his death : and for my part , i know no personall cause , to spurne at him , but for the generall .
he would be crown ' d : how that might change his nature , there ' s the question ?
it is the bright day , that brings forth the adder , and that craues warie walking : crowne him that , and then i graunt we put a sting in him , that at his will he may doe danger with .
th ' abuse of greatnesse , is , when it dis - ioynes remorse from power : and to speake truth of caesar , i haue not knowne , when his affections sway ' d more then his reason .
but ' tis a common proofe , that lowlynesse is young ambitions ladder , whereto the climber vpward turnes his face : but when he once attaines the vpmost round , he then vnto the ladder turnes his backe , lookes in the clouds , scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend : so caesar may ; then least he may , preuent .
and since the quarrell will beare no colour , for the thing he is , fashion it thus ; that what he is , augmented , would runne to these , and these extremities : and therefore thinke him as a serpents egge , which hatch ' d , would as his kinde grow mischieuous ; and kill him in the shell .
enter lucius .
luc .
the taper burneth in your closet , sir : searching the window for a flint , i found this paper , thus seal ' d vp , and i am sure it did not lye there when i went to bed .

get you to bed againe , it is not day : is not to morrow ( boy ) the first of march ?
luc .
i know not , sir
brut .
looke in the calender , and bring me word
luc .
i will , sir .
enter .
brut .
the exhalations , whizzing in the ayre , giue so much light , that i may reade by them .
opens the letter , and reades .
brutus thou sleep ' st ; awake , and see thy selfe : shall rome , & c . speake , strike , redresse .
brutus , thou sleep ' st : awake .
such instigations haue beene often dropt , where i haue tooke them vp : shall rome , & c . thus must i piece it out : shall rome stand vnder one mans awe ?
what rome ?
my ancestors did from the streetes of rome the tarquin driue , when he was call ' d a king .
speake , strike , redresse .
am i entreated to speake , and strike ?
o rome , i make thee promise , if the redresse will follow , thou receiuest thy full petition at the hand of brutus .
enter lucius .
luc .
sir , march is wasted fifteene dayes .
knocke within .
brut .
' tis good .
go to the gate , some body knocks : since cassius first did whet me against caesar , i haue not slept .
betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing , and the first motion , all the interim is like a phantasma , or a hideous dreame : the genius , and the mortall instruments are then in councell ; and the state of a man , like to a little kingdome , suffers then the nature of an insurrection .
enter lucius .
luc .
sir , ' tis your brother cassius at the doore , who doth desire to see you
brut .
is he alone ?
luc .
no , sir , there are moe with him
brut .
doe you know them ?
luc .
no , sir , their hats are pluckt about their eares , and halfe their faces buried in their cloakes , that by no meanes i may discouer them , by any marke of fauour
brut .
let ' em enter : they are the faction .
o conspiracie , sham ' st thou to shew thy dang ' rous brow by night , when euills are most free ?
o then , by day where wilt thou finde a cauerne darke enough , to maske thy monstrous visage ?
seek none conspiracie , hide it in smiles , and affabilitie : for if thou path thy natiue semblance on , not erebus it selfe were dimme enough , to hide thee from preuention .
enter the conspirators , cassius , caska , decius , cinna , metellus , and trebonius .
cass .
i thinke we are too bold vpon your rest : good morrow brutus , doe we trouble you ?
brut .
i haue beene vp this howre , awake all night : know i these men , that come along with you ?
cass .
yes , euery man of them ; and no man here but honors you : and euery one doth wish , you had but that opinion of your selfe , which euery noble roman beares of you .
this is trebonius
brut .
he is welcome hither
cass .
this , decius brutus
brut .
he is welcome too
cass .
this , caska ; this , cinna ; and this , metellus cymber
brut .
they are all welcome .
what watchfull cares doe interpose themselues betwixt your eyes , and night ?
cass .
shall i entreat a word ?
they whisper .
decius .
here lyes the east : doth not the day breake heere ?
cask .
no
cin .
o pardon , sir , it doth ; and yon grey lines , that fret the clouds , are messengers of day
cask .
you shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : heere , as i point my sword , the sunne arises , which is a great way growing on the south , weighing the youthfull season of the yeare .
some two moneths hence , vp higher toward the north he first presents his fire , and the high east stands as the capitoll , directly heere
bru .
giue me your hands all ouer , one by one
cas .
and let vs sweare our resolution
brut .
no , not an oath : if not the face of men , the sufferance of our soules , the times abuse ; if these be motiues weake , breake off betimes , and euery man hence , to his idle bed : so let high - sighted - tyranny range on , till each man drop by lottery .
but if these ( as i am sure they do ) beare fire enough to kindle cowards , and to steele with valour the melting spirits of women .
then countrymen , what neede we any spurre , but our owne cause to pricke vs to redresse ?
what other bond , then secret romans , that haue spoke the word , and will not palter ?
and what other oath , then honesty to honesty ingag ' d , that this shall be , or we will fall for it .
sweare priests and cowards , and men cautelous old feeble carrions , and such suffering soules that welcome wrongs : vnto bad causes , sweare such creatures as men doubt ; but do not staine the euen vertue of our enterprize , nor th ' insuppressiue mettle of our spirits , to thinke , that or our cause , or our performance did neede an oath .
when euery drop of blood that euery roman beares , and nobly beares is guilty of a seuerall bastardie , if he do breake the smallest particle of any promise that hath past from him
cas .
but what of cicero ?
shall we sound him ?
i thinke he will stand very strong with vs
cask .
let vs not leaue him out
cyn .
no , by no meanes
metel .
o let vs haue him , for his siluer haires will purchase vs a good opinion : and buy mens voyces , to commend our deeds : it shall be sayd , his iudgement rul ' d our hands , our youths , and wildenesse , shall no whit appeare , but all be buried in his grauity
bru .
o name him not ; let vs not breake with him , for he will neuer follow any thing that other men begin
cas .
then leaue him out
cask .
indeed , he is not fit
decius .
shall no man else be toucht , but onely caesar ?
cas .
decius well vrg ' d : i thinke it is not meet , marke antony , so well belou ' d of caesar , should out - liue caesar , we shall finde of him a shrew ' d contriuer .
and you know , his meanes if he improue them , may well stretch so farre as to annoy vs all : which to preuent , let antony and caesar fall together
bru .
our course will seeme too bloody , caius cassius , to cut the head off , and then hacke the limbes : like wrath in death , and enuy afterwards : for antony , is but a limbe of caesar .
let ' s be sacrificers , but not butchers caius : we all stand vp against the spirit of caesar , and in the spirit of men , there is no blood : o that we then could come by caesars spirit , and not dismember caesar !
but ( alas ) caesar must bleed for it .
and gentle friends , let ' s kill him boldly , but not wrathfully : let ' s carue him , as a dish fit for the gods , not hew him as a carkasse fit for hounds : and let our hearts , as subtle masters do , stirre vp their seruants to an acte of rage , and after seeme to chide ' em .
this shall make our purpose necessary , and not enuious .
which so appearing to the common eyes , we shall be call ' d purgers , not murderers .
and for marke antony , thinke not of him : for he can do no more then caesars arme , when caesars head is off
cas .
yet i feare him , for in the ingrafted loue he beares to caesar
bru .
alas , good cassius , do not thinke of him : if he loue caesar , all that he can do is to himselfe ; take thought , and dye for caesar , and that were much he should : for he is giuen to sports , to wildenesse , and much company
treb .
there is no feare in him ; let him not dye , for he will liue , and laugh at this heereafter .
clocke strikes .
bru .
peace , count the clocke
cas .
the clocke hath stricken three
treb .
' tis time to part
cass .
but it is doubtfull yet , whether caesar will come forth to day , or no : for he is superstitious growne of late , quite from the maine opinion he held once , of fantasie , of dreames , and ceremonies : it may be , these apparant prodigies , the vnaccustom ' d terror of this night , and the perswasion of his augurers , may hold him from the capitoll to day
decius .
neuer feare that : if he be so resolu ' d , i can ore - sway him : for he loues to heare , that vnicornes may be betray ' d with trees , and beares with glasses , elephants with holes , lyons with toyles , and men with flatterers .
but , when i tell him , he hates flatterers , he sayes , he does ; being then most flattered .
let me worke : for i can giue his humour the true bent ; and i will bring him to the capitoll
cas .
nay , we will all of vs , be there to fetch him
bru .
by the eight houre , is that the vttermost ?
cin .
be that the vttermost , and faile not then
met .
caius ligarius doth beare caesar hard , who rated him for speaking well of pompey ; i wonder none of you haue thought of him
bru .
now good metellus go along by him : he loues me well , and i haue giuen him reasons , send him but hither , and ile fashion him
cas .
the morning comes vpon ' s : wee ' l leaue you brutus , and friends disperse your selues ; but all remember what you haue said , and shew your selues true romans
bru .
good gentlemen , looke fresh and merrily , let not our lookes put on our purposes , but beare it as our roman actors do , with vntyr ' d spirits , and formall constancie , and so good morrow to you euery one .

portia : what meane you ?
wherfore rise you now ?
it is not for your health , thus to commit your weake condition , to the raw cold morning
por .
nor for yours neither .
y ' haue vngently brutus stole from my bed : and yesternight at supper you sodainly arose , and walk ' d about , musing , and sighing , with your armes acrosse and when i ask ' d you what the matter was , you star ' d vpon me , with vngentle lookes .
i vrg ' d you further , then you scratch ' d your head , and too impatiently stampt with your foote : yet i insisted , yet you answer ' d not , but with an angry wafter of your hand gaue signe for me to leaue you : so i did , fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem ' d too much inkindled ; and withall , hoping it was but an effect of humor , which sometime hath his houre with euery man .
it will not let you eate , nor talke , nor sleepe ; and could it worke so much vpon your shape , as it hath much preuayl ' d on your condition , i should not know you brutus .
deare my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of greefe
bru .
i am not well in health , and that is all
por .
brutus is wise , and were he not in health , he would embrace the meanes to come by it
bru .
why so i do : good portia go to bed
por .
is brutus sicke ?
and is it physicall to walke vnbraced , and sucke vp the humours of the danke morning ?
what , is brutus sicke ?
and will he steale out of his wholsome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night ?
and tempt the rhewmy , and vnpurged ayre , to adde vnto his sicknesse ?
no my brutus , you haue some sicke offence within your minde , which by the right and vertue of my place i ought to know of : and vpon my knees , i charme you , by my once commended beauty , by all your vowes of loue , and that great vow which did incorporate and make vs one , that you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe why you are heauy : and what men to night haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces euen from darknesse

within the bond of marriage , tell me brutus , is it excepted , i should know no secrets that appertaine to you ?
am i your selfe , but as it were in sort , or limitation ?
to keepe with you at meales , comfort your bed , and talke to you sometimes ?
dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure ?
if it be no more , portia is brutus harlot , not his wife
bru .
you are my true and honourable wife , as deere to me , as are the ruddy droppes that visit my sad heart
por .
if this were true , then should i know this secret .
i graunt i am a woman ; but withall , a woman that lord brutus tooke to wife : i graunt i am a woman ; but withall , a woman well reputed : cato ' s daughter .
thinke you , i am no stronger then my sex being so father ' d , and so husbanded ?
tell me your counsels , i will not disclose ' em : i haue made strong proofe of my constancie , giuing my selfe a voluntary wound heere , in the thigh : can i beare that with patience , and not my husbands secrets ?

what mean you caesar ?
think you to walk forth ?
you shall not stirre out of your house to day
caes caesar shall forth ; the things that threaten ' d me , ne ' re look ' d but on my backe : when they shall see the face of caesar , they are vanished
calp .
caesar , i neuer stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me : there is one within , besides the things that we haue heard and seene , recounts most horrid sights seene by the watch .
a lionnesse hath whelped in the streets , and graues haue yawn ' d , and yeelded vp their dead ; fierce fiery warriours fight vpon the clouds in rankes and squadrons , and right forme of warre which drizel ' d blood vpon the capitoll : the noise of battell hurtled in the ayre : horsses do neigh , and dying men did grone , and ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets .
o caesar , these things are beyond all vse , and i do feare them
caes what can be auoyded whose end is purpos ' d by the mighty gods ?
yet caesar shall go forth : for these predictions are to the world in generall , as to caesar
calp .
when beggers dye , there are no comets seen , the heauens themselues blaze forth the death of princes caes cowards dye many times before their deaths , the valiant neuer taste of death but once : of all the wonders that i yet haue heard , it seemes to me most strange that men should feare , seeing that death , a necessary end will come , when it will come .
enter a seruant .
what say the augurers ?
ser .
they would not haue you to stirre forth to day .
plucking the intrailes of an offering forth , they could not finde a heart within the beast
caes the gods do this in shame of cowardice : caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home to day for feare : no caesar shall not ; danger knowes full well that caesar is more dangerous then he .
we heare two lyons litter ' d in one day , and i the elder and more terrible , and caesar shall go foorth
calp .
alas my lord , your wisedome is consum ' d in confidence : do not go forth to day : call it my feare , that keepes you in the house , and not your owne .
wee ' l send mark antony to the senate house , and he shall say , you are not well to day : let me vpon my knee , preuaile in this
caes mark antony shall say i am not well , and for thy humor , i will stay at home .
enter decius .
heere ' s decius brutus , he shall tell them so
deci .
caesar , all haile : good morrow worthy caesar , i come to fetch you to the senate house
caes and you are come in very happy time , to beare my greeting to the senators , and tell them that i will not come to day : cannot , is false : and that i dare not , falser : i will not come to day , tell them so decius
calp .
say he is sicke
caes shall caesar send a lye ?
haue i in conquest stretcht mine arme so farre , to be afear ' d to tell gray - beards the truth : decius , go tell them , caesar will not come
deci .
most mighty caesar , let me know some cause , lest i be laught at when i tell them so
caes the cause is in my will , i will not come , that is enough to satisfie the senate .
but for your priuate satisfaction , because i loue you , i will let you know .
calphurnia heere my wife , stayes me at home : she dreampt to night , she saw my statue , which like a fountaine , with an hundred spouts did run pure blood : and many lusty romans came smiling , & did bathe their hands in it : and these does she apply , for warnings and portents , and euils imminent ; and on her knee hath begg ' d , that i will stay at home to day
deci .
this dreame is all amisse interpreted , it was a vision , faire and fortunate : your statue spouting blood in many pipes , in which so many smiling romans bath ' d , signifies , that from you great rome shall sucke reuiuing blood , and that great men shall presse for tinctures , staines , reliques , and cognisance .
this by calphurnia ' s dreame is signified
caes and this way haue you well expounded it
deci .
i haue , when you haue heard what i can say : and know it now , the senate haue concluded to giue this day , a crowne to mighty caesar .
if you shall send them word you will not come , their mindes may change .
besides , it were a mocke apt to be render ' d , for some one to say , breake vp the senate , till another time : when caesars wife shall meete with better dreames .
if caesar hide himselfe , shall they not whisper loe caesar is affraid ?
pardon me caesar , for my deere deere loue to your proceeding , bids me tell you this : and reason to my loue is liable
caes how foolish do your fears seeme now calphurnia ?
i am ashamed i did yeeld to them .
giue me my robe , for i will go .

most high , most mighty , and most puisant caesar metellus cymber throwes before thy seate an humble heart
caes i must preuent thee cymber : these couchings , and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men , and turne pre - ordinance , and first decree into the lane of children .
be not fond , to thinke that caesar beares such rebell blood that will be thaw ' d from the true quality with that which melteth fooles , i meane sweet words , low - crooked - curtsies , and base spaniell fawning : thy brother by decree is banished : if thou doest bend , and pray , and fawne for him , i spurne thee like a curre out of my way : know , caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause will he be satisfied
metel .
is there no voyce more worthy then my owne , to sound more sweetly in great caesars eare , for the repealing of my banish ' d brother ?

i kisse thy hand , but not in flattery caesar : desiring thee , that publius cymber may haue an immediate freedome of repeale
caes what brutus ?

pardon caesar : caesar pardon : as lowe as to thy foote doth cassius fall , to begge infranchisement for publius cymber
caes i could be well mou ' d , if i were as you , if i could pray to mooue , prayers would mooue me : but i am constant as the northerne starre , of whose true fixt , and resting quality , there is no fellow in the firmament .

so , in the world ; ' tis furnish ' d well with men , and men are flesh and blood , and apprehensiue ; yet in the number , i do know but one that vnassayleable holds on his ranke , vnshak ' d of motion : and that i am he , let me a little shew it , euen in this : that i was constant cymber should be banish ' d , and constant do remaine to keepe him so

thus brutus did my master bid me kneele ; thus did mark antony bid me fall downe , and being prostrate , thus he bad me say : brutus is noble , wise , valiant , and honest ; caesar was mighty , bold , royall , and louing : say , i loue brutus , and i honour him ; say , i fear ' d caesar , honour ' d him , and lou ' d him .
if brutus will vouchsafe , that antony may safely come to him , and be resolu ' d how caesar hath deseru ' d to lye in death , mark antony , shall not loue caesar dead so well as brutus liuing ; but will follow the fortunes and affayres of noble brutus , thorough the hazards of this vntrod state , with all true faith .

o mighty caesar !
dost thou lye so lowe ?
are all thy conquests , glories , triumphes , spoiles , shrunke to this little measure ?
fare thee well .
i know not gentlemen what you intend , who else must be let blood , who else is ranke : if i my selfe , there is no houre so fit as caesars deaths houre ; nor no instrument of halfe that worth , as those your swords ; made rich with the most noble blood of all this world .
i do beseech yee , if you beare me hard , now , whil ' st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake , fulfill your pleasure .
liue a thousand yeeres , i shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye .
no place will please me so , no meane of death , as heere by caesar , and by you cut off , the choice and master spirits of this age
bru .
o antony !
begge not your death of vs : though now we must appeare bloody and cruell , as by our hands , and this our present acte you see we do : yet see you but our hands , and this , the bleeding businesse they haue done : our hearts you see not , they are pittifull : and pitty to the generall wrong of rome , as fire driues out fire , so pitty , pitty hath done this deed on caesar .
for your part , to you , our swords haue leaden points marke antony : our armes in strength of malice , and our hearts of brothers temper , do receiue you in , with all kinde loue , good thoughts , and reuerence
cassi .
your voyce shall be as strong as any mans , in the disposing of new dignities
bru .
onely be patient , till we haue appeas ' d the multitude , beside themselues with feare , and then , we will deliuer you the cause , why i , that did loue caesar when i strooke him , haue thus proceeded
ant .
i doubt not of your wisedome : let each man render me his bloody hand .
first marcus brutus will i shake with you ; next caius cassius do i take your hand ; now decius brutus yours ; now yours metellus ; yours cinna ; and my valiant caska , yours ; though last , not least in loue , yours good trebonius .
gentlemen all : alas , what shall i say , my credit now stands on such slippery ground , that one of two bad wayes you must conceit me , either a coward , or a flatterer .
that i did loue thee caesar , o ' tis true : if then thy spirit looke vpon vs now , shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death , to see thy antony making his peace , shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes ?
most noble , in the presence of thy coarse , had i as many eyes , as thou hast wounds , weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood , it would become me better , then to close in tearmes of friendship with thine enemies .
pardon me iulius , heere was ' t thou bay ' d braue hart , heere did ' st thou fall , and heere thy hunters stand sign ' d in thy spoyle , and crimson ' d in thy lethee .
o world !
thou wast the forrest to this hart , and this indeed , o world , the hart of thee .
how like a deere , stroken by many princes , dost thou heere lye ?
cassi .
mark antony
ant .
pardon me caius cassius : the enemies of caesar , shall say this : then , in a friend , it is cold modestie
cassi .
i blame you not for praising caesar so .
but what compact meane you to haue with vs ?
will you be prick ' d in number of our friends , or shall we on , and not depend on you ?
ant .
therefore i tooke your hands , but was indeed sway ' d from the point , by looking downe on caesar .
friends am i with you all , and loue you all , vpon this hope , that you shall giue me reasons , why , and wherein , caesar was dangerous
bru .
or else were this a sauage spectacle : our reasons are so full of good regard , that were you antony , the sonne of caesar , you should be satisfied
ant .
that ' s all i seeke , and am moreouer sutor , that i may produce his body to the market - place , and in the pulpit as becomes a friend , speake in the order of his funerall
bru .
you shall marke antony
cassi .
brutus , a word with you : you know not what you do ; do not consent that antony speake in his funerall : know you how much the people may be mou ' d by that which he will vtter
bru .
by your pardon : i will my selfe into the pulpit first , and shew the reason of our caesars death .
what antony shall speake , i will protest he speakes by leaue , and by permission : and that we are contented caesar shall haue all true rites , and lawfull ceremonies , it shall aduantage more , then do vs wrong
cassi .
i know not what may fall , i like it not
bru .
mark antony , heere take you caesars body : you shall not in your funerall speech blame vs , but speake all good you can deuise of caesar , and say you doo ' t by our permission : else shall you not haue any hand at all about his funerall .
and you shall speake in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended
ant .
be it so : i do desire no more
bru .
prepare the body then , and follow vs .

o pardon me , thou bleeding peece of earth : that i am meeke and gentle with these butchers .

woe to the hand that shed this costly blood .
ouer thy wounds , now do i prophesie , ( which like dumbe mouthes do ope their ruby lips , to begge the voyce and vtterance of my tongue ) a curse shall light vpon the limbes of men ; domesticke fury , and fierce ciuill strife , shall cumber all the parts of italy : blood and destruction shall be so in vse , and dreadfull obiects so familiar , that mothers shall but smile , when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of warre : all pitty choak ' d with custome of fell deeds , and caesars spirit ranging for reuenge , with ate by his side , come hot from hell , shall in these confines , with a monarkes voyce , cry hauocke , and let slip the dogges of warre , that this foule deede , shall smell aboue the earth with carrion men , groaning for buriall .

if there bee any in this assembly , any deere friend of caesars , to him i say , that brutus loue to caesar , was no lesse then his .
if then , that friend demand , why brutus rose against caesar , this is my answer : not that i lou ' d caesar lesse , but that i lou ' d rome more .
had you rather caesar were liuing , and dye all slaues ; then that caesar were dead , to liue all free - men ?
as caesar lou ' d mee , i weepe for him ; as he was fortunate , i reioyce at it ; as he was valiant , i honour him : but , as he was ambitious , i slew him .
there is teares , for his loue : ioy , for his fortune : honor , for his valour : and death , for his ambition .
who is heere so base , that would be a bondman ?
if any , speak , for him haue i offended .
who is heere so rude , that would not be a roman ?
if any , speak , for him haue i offended .
who is heere so vile , that will not loue his countrey ?
if any , speake , for him haue i offended .
i pause for a reply
all .
none brutus , none
brutus .
then none haue i offended .
i haue done no more to caesar , then you shall do to brutus .
the question of his death , is inroll ' d in the capitoll : his glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy ; nor his offences enforc ' d , for which he suffered death .
enter mark antony , with caesars body .
heere comes his body , mourn ' d by marke antony , who though he had no hand in his death , shall receiue the benefit of his dying , a place in the co [ m ] monwealth , as which of you shall not .

3 nay that ' s certaine : we are blest that rome is rid of him
2 peace , let vs heare what antony can say
ant .
you gentle romans
all .
peace hoe , let vs heare him
an .
friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ears : i come to bury caesar , not to praise him : the euill that men do , liues after them , the good is oft enterred with their bones , so let it be with caesar .
the noble brutus , hath told you caesar was ambitious : if it were so , it was a greeuous fault , and greeuously hath caesar answer ' d it .
heere , vnder leaue of brutus , and the rest ( for brutus is an honourable man , so are they all ; all honourable men ) come i to speake in caesars funerall .
he was my friend , faithfull , and iust to me ; but brutus sayes , he was ambitious , and brutus is an honourable man .
he hath brought many captiues home to rome , whose ransomes , did the generall coffers fill : did this in caesar seeme ambitious ?
when that the poore haue cry ' de , caesar hath wept : ambition should be made of sterner stuffe , yet brutus sayes , he was ambitious : and brutus is an honourable man .
you all did see , that on the lupercall , i thrice presented him a kingly crowne , which he did thrice refuse .
was this ambition ?
yet brutus sayes , he was ambitious : and sure he is an honourable man .
i speake not to disprooue what brutus spoke , but heere i am , to speake what i do know ; you all did loue him once , not without cause , what cause with - holds you then , to mourne for him ?
o iudgement !
thou are fled to brutish beasts , and men haue lost their reason .
beare with me , my heart is in the coffin there with caesar , and i must pawse , till it come backe to me
1 me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings
2 if thou consider rightly of the matter , caesar ha ' s had great wrong
3 ha ' s hee masters ?
i feare there will a worse come in his place
4 .
mark ' d ye his words ?
he would not take y crown , therefore ' tis certaine , he was not ambitious
1 .
if it be found so , some will deere abide it
2 .
poore soule , his eyes are red as fire with weeping
3 .
there ' s not a nobler man in rome then antony
4 .
now marke him , he begins againe to speake
ant .
but yesterday , the word of caesar might haue stood against the world : now lies he there , and none so poore to do him reuerence .
o maisters !
if i were dispos ' d to stirre your hearts and mindes to mutiny and rage , i should do brutus wrong , and cassius wrong : who ( you all know ) are honourable men .
i will not do them wrong : i rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong my selfe and you , then i will wrong such honourable men .
but heere ' s a parchment , with the seale of caesar , i found it in his closset , ' tis his will : let but the commons heare this testament : ( which pardon me ) i do not meane to reade , and they would go and kisse dead caesars wounds , and dip their napkins in his sacred blood ; yea , begge a haire of him for memory , and dying , mention it within their willes , bequeathing it as a rich legacie vnto their issue
4 wee ' l heare the will , reade it marke antony
all .
the will , the will ; we will heare caesars will
ant .
haue patience gentle friends , i must not read it .
it is not meete you know how caesar lou ' d you : you are not wood , you are not stones , but men : and being men , hearing the will of caesar , it will inflame you , it will make you mad : ' tis good you know not that you are his heires , for if you should , o what would come of it ?
4 read the will , wee ' l heare it antony : you shall reade vs the will , caesars will
ant .
will you be patient ?
will you stay a - while ?
i haue o ' re - shot my selfe to tell you of it , i feare i wrong the honourable men , whose daggers haue stabb ' d caesar : i do feare it
4 they were traitors : honourable men ?
all .
the will , the testament
2 they were villaines , murderers : the will , read the will
ant .
you will compell me then to read the will : then make a ring about the corpes of caesar , and let me shew you him that made the will : shall i descend ?
and will you giue me leaue ?
all .
come downe
2 descend
3 you shall haue leaue
4 a ring , stand round
1 stand from the hearse , stand from the body
2 roome for antony , most noble antony
ant .
nay presse not so vpon me , stand farre off
all .
stand backe : roome , beare backe
ant .
if you haue teares , prepare to shed them now .
you all do know this mantle , i remember the first time euer caesar put it on , ' twas on a summers euening in his tent , that day he ouercame the neruij .
looke , in this place ran cassius dagger through : see what a rent the enuious caska made : through this , the wel - beloued brutus stabb ' d , and as he pluck ' d his cursed steele away : marke how the blood of caesar followed it , as rushing out of doores , to be resolu ' d if brutus so vnkindely knock ' d , or no : for brutus , as you know , was caesars angel .
iudge , o you gods , how deerely caesar lou ' d him : this was the most vnkindest cut of all .
for when the noble caesar saw him stab , ingratitude , more strong then traitors armes , quite vanquish ' d him : then burst his mighty heart , and in his mantle , muffling vp his face , euen at the base of pompeyes statue ( which all the while ran blood ) great caesar fell .
o what a fall was there , my countrymen ?
then i , and you , and all of vs fell downe , whil ' st bloody treason flourish ' d ouer vs . o now you weepe , and i perceiue you feele the dint of pitty : these are gracious droppes .
kinde soules , what weepe you , when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded ?

good friends , sweet friends , let me not stirre you vp to such a sodaine flood of mutiny : they that haue done this deede , are honourable .
what priuate greefes they haue , alas i know not , that made them do it : they are wise , and honourable , and will no doubt with reasons answer you .
i come not ( friends ) to steale away your hearts , i am no orator , as brutus is : but ( as you know me all ) a plaine blunt man that loue my friend , and that they know full well , that gaue me publike leaue to speake of him : for i haue neyther writ nor words , nor worth , action , nor vtterance , nor the power of speech , to stirre mens blood .
i onely speake right on : i tell you that , which you your selues do know , shew you sweet caesars wounds , poor poor dum mouths and bid them speake for me : but were i brutus , and brutus antony , there were an antony would ruffle vp your spirits , and put a tongue in euery wound of caesar , that should moue the stones of rome , to rise and mutiny

that you haue wrong ' d me , doth appear in this : you haue condemn ' d , and noted lucius pella for taking bribes heere of the sardians ; wherein my letters , praying on his side , because i knew the man was slighted off
bru .
you wrong ' d your selfe to write in such a case
cassi .
in such a time as this , it is not meet that euery nice offence should beare his comment
bru .
let me tell you cassius , you your selfe are much condemn ' d to haue an itching palme , to sell , and mart your offices for gold to vndeseruers
cassi .
i , an itching palme ?
you know that you are brutus that speakes this , or by the gods , this speech were else your last
bru .
the name of cassius honors this corruption , and chasticement doth therefore hide his head
cassi .
chasticement ?
bru .
remember march , the ides of march reme [ m ] ber : did not great iulius bleede for iustice sake ?
what villaine touch ' d his body , that did stab , and not for iustice ?
what ?
shall one of vs , that strucke the formost man of all this world , but for supporting robbers : shall we now , contaminate our fingers , with base bribes ?
and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash , as may be grasped thus ?
i had rather be a dogge , and bay the moone , then such a roman
cassi .
brutus , baite not me , ile not indure it : you forget your selfe to hedge me in .
i am a souldier , i , older in practice , abler then your selfe to make conditions
bru .
go too : you are not cassius
cassi .
i am
bru .
i say , you are not
cassi .
vrge me no more , i shall forget my selfe : haue minde vpon your health : tempt me no farther
bru .
away slight man
cassi .
is ' t possible ?
bru .
heare me , for i will speake .
must i giue way , and roome to your rash choller ?
shall i be frighted , when a madman stares ?
cassi .
o ye gods , ye gods , must i endure all this ?
bru .
all this ?
i more : fret till your proud hart break .
go shew your slaues how chollericke you are , and make your bondmen tremble .
must i bouge ?
must i obserue you ?
must i stand and crouch vnder your testie humour ?
by the gods , you shall digest the venom of your spleene though it do split you .
for , from this day forth , ile vse you for my mirth , yea for my laughter when you are waspish
cassi .
is it come to this ?
bru .
you say , you are a better souldier : let it appeare so ; make your vaunting true , and it shall please me well .
for mine owne part , i shall be glad to learne of noble men
cass .
you wrong me euery way : you wrong me brutus : i saide , an elder souldier , not a better .
did i say better ?
bru .
if you did , i care not
cass .
when caesar liu ' d , he durst not thus haue mou ' d me
brut .
peace , peace , you durst not so haue tempted him
cassi .
i durst not
bru .
no
cassi .
what ?
durst not tempt him ?
bru .
for your life you durst not
cassi .
do not presume too much vpon my loue , i may do that i shall be sorry for
bru .
you haue done that you should be sorry for .
there is no terror cassius in your threats : for i am arm ' d so strong in honesty , that they passe by me , as the idle winde , which i respect not .
i did send to you for certaine summes of gold , which you deny ' d me , for i can raise no money by vile meanes : by heauen , i had rather coine my heart , and drop my blood for drachmaes , then to wring from the hard hands of peazants , their vile trash by any indirection .
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions , which you deny ' d me : was that done like cassius ?
should i haue answer ' d caius cassius so ?
when marcus brutus growes so couetous , to locke such rascall counters from his friends , be ready gods with all your thunder - bolts , dash him to peeces
cassi .
i deny ' d you not
bru .
you did
cassi .
i did not .
he was but a foole that brought my answer back .
brutus hath riu ' d my hart : a friend should beare his friends infirmities ; but brutus makes mine greater then they are
bru .
i do not , till you practice them on me
cassi .
you loue me not
bru .
i do not like your faults
cassi .
a friendly eye could neuer see such faults
bru .
a flatterers would not , though they do appeare as huge as high olympus
cassi .
come antony , and yong octauius come , reuenge your selues alone on cassius , for cassius is a - weary of the world : hated by one he loues , brau ' d by his brother , check ' d like a bondman , all his faults obseru ' d , set in a note - booke , learn ' d , and con ' d by roate to cast into my teeth .
o i could weepe my spirit from mine eyes .
there is my dagger , and heere my naked breast : within , a heart deerer then pluto ' s mine , richer then gold : if that thou bee ' st a roman , take it foorth .
i that deny ' d thee gold , will giue my heart : strike as thou did ' st at caesar : for i know , when thou did ' st hate him worst , y loued ' st him better then euer thou loued ' st cassius
bru .
sheath your dagger : be angry when you will , it shall haue scope : do what you will , dishonor , shall be humour .
o cassius , you are yoaked with a lambe that carries anger , as the flint beares fire , who much inforced , shewes a hastie sparke , and straite is cold agen
cassi .
hath cassius liu ' d to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus , when greefe and blood ill temper ' d , vexeth him ?
bru .
when i spoke that , i was ill temper ' d too
cassi .
do you confesse so much ?
giue me your hand
bru .
and my heart too
cassi .
o brutus !
bru .
what ' s the matter ?
cassi .
haue not you loue enough to beare with me , when that rash humour which my mother gaue me makes me forgetfull
bru .
yes cassius , and from henceforth when you are ouer - earnest with your brutus , hee ' l thinke your mother chides , and leaue you so .

bru .

bru .
lucius , a bowle of wine
cas .
i did not thinke you could haue bin so angry
bru .
o cassius , i am sicke of many greefes
cas .
of your philosophy you make no vse , if you giue place to accidentall euils
bru .
no man beares sorrow better .
portia is dead
cas .
ha ?
portia ?
bru .
she is dead
cas .
how scap ' d i killing , when i crost you so ?
o insupportable , and touching losse !
vpon what sicknesse ?
bru .
impatient of my absence , and greefe , that yong octauius with mark antony haue made themselues so strong : for with her death that tydings came .
with this she fell distract , and ( her attendants absent ) swallow ' d fire
cas .
and dy ' d so ?
bru .
euen so
cas .
o ye immortall gods !
enter boy with wine , and tapers .
bru .
speak no more of her : giue me a bowl of wine , in this i bury all vnkindnesse cassius .
drinkes
cas .
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
fill lucius , till the wine ore - swell the cup : i cannot drinke too much of brutus loue .
enter titinius and messala .
brutus .
come in titinius : welcome good messala : now sit we close about this taper heere , and call in question our necessities
cass .
portia , art thou gone ?
bru .
no more i pray you .
messala , i haue heere receiued letters , that yong octauius , and marke antony come downe vpon vs with a mighty power , bending their expedition toward philippi
mess .
my selfe haue letters of the selfe - same tenure
bru .
with what addition
mess .
that by proscription , and billes of outlarie , octauius , antony , and lepidus , haue put to death , an hundred senators
bru .
therein our letters do not well agree : mine speake of seuenty senators , that dy ' de by their proscriptions , cicero being one
cassi .
cicero one ?
messa .
cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription had you your letters from your wife , my lord ?
bru .
no messala
messa .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
bru .
nothing messala
messa .
that me thinkes is strange
bru .
why aske you ?
heare you ought of her , in yours ?
messa .
no my lord
bru .
now as you are a roman tell me true
messa .
then like a roman , beare the truth i tell , for certaine she is dead , and by strange manner
bru .
why farewell portia : we must die messala : with meditating that she must dye once , i haue the patience to endure it now
messa .
euen so great men , great losses shold indure
cassi .
i haue as much of this in art as you , but yet my nature could not beare it so
bru .
well , to our worke aliue .
what do you thinke of marching to philippi presently
cassi .
i do not thinke it good
bru .
your reason ?
cassi .
this it is : ' tis better that the enemie seeke vs , so shall he waste his meanes , weary his souldiers , doing himselfe offence , whil ' st we lying still , are full of rest , defence , and nimblenesse
bru .
good reasons must of force giue place to better : the people ' twixt philippi , and this ground do stand but in a forc ' d affection : for they haue grug ' d vs contribution .
the enemy , marching along by them , by them shall make a fuller number vp , come on refresht , new added , and encourag ' d : from which aduantage shall we cut him off .
if at philippi we do face him there , these people at our backe
cassi .
heare me good brother
bru .
vnder your pardon .
you must note beside , that we haue tride the vtmost of our friends : our legions are brim full , our cause is ripe , the enemy encreaseth euery day , we at the height , are readie to decline .
there is a tide in the affayres of men , which taken at the flood , leades on to fortune : omitted , all the voyage of their life , is bound in shallowes , and in miseries .
on such a full sea are we now a - float , and we must take the current when it serues , or loose our ventures
cassi .
then with your will go on : wee ' l along our selues , and meet them at philippi
bru .
the deepe of night is crept vpon our talke , and nature must obey necessitie , which we will niggard with a little rest : there is no more to say
cassi .
no more , good night , early to morrow will we rise , and hence .
enter lucius .

ant .
not stinglesse too
bru .
o yes , and soundlesse too : for you haue stolne their buzzing antony , and very wisely threat before you sting
ant .
villains : you did not so , when your vile daggers hackt one another in the sides of caesar : you shew ' d your teethes like apes , and fawn ' d like hounds , and bow ' d like bondmen , kissing caesars feete ; whil ' st damned caska , like a curre , behinde strooke caesar on the necke .

if cassius might haue rul ' d
octa .
come , come , the cause .
if arguing make vs swet , the proofe of it will turne to redder drops : looke , i draw a sword against conspirators , when thinke you that the sword goes vp againe ?
neuer till caesars three and thirtie wounds be well aueng ' d ; or till another caesar haue added slaughter to the sword of traitors
brut .
caesar , thou canst not dye by traitors hands .
vnlesse thou bring ' st them with thee

so i hope : i was not borne to dye on brutus sword

cassi .
messala
messa .
what sayes my generall ?
cassi .
messala , this is my birth - day : at this very day was cassius borne .
giue me thy hand messala : be thou my witnesse , that against my will ( as pompey was ) am i compell ' d to set vpon one battell all our liberties .
you know , that i held epicurus strong , and his opinion : now i change my minde , and partly credit things that do presage .
comming from sardis , on our former ensigne two mighty eagles fell , and there they pearch ' d , gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands , who to philippi heere consorted vs : this morning are they fled away , and gone , and in their steeds , do rauens , crowes , and kites fly ore our heads , and downward looke on vs as we were sickely prey ; their shadowes seeme a canopy most fatall , vnder which our army lies , ready to giue vp the ghost
messa .
beleeue not so
cassi .
i but beleeue it partly , for i am fresh of spirit , and resolu ' d to meete all perils , very constantly
bru .
euen so lucillius
cassi .
now most noble brutus , the gods to day stand friendly , that we may louers in peace , leade on our dayes to age .
but since the affayres of men rests still incertaine , let ' s reason with the worst that may befall .
if we do lose this battaile , then is this the very last time we shall speake together : what are you then determined to do ?
bru .
euen by the rule of that philosophy , by which i did blame cato , for the death which he did giue himselfe , i know not how : but i do finde it cowardly , and vile , for feare of what might fall , so to preuent the time of life , arming my selfe with patience , to stay the prouidence of some high powers , that gouerne vs below
cassi .
then , if we loose this battaile , you are contented to be led in triumph thorow the streets of rome
bru .
no cassius , no : thinke not thou noble romane , that euer brutus will go bound to rome , he beares too great a minde .
but this same day must end that worke , the ides of march begun .
and whether we shall meete againe , i know not : therefore our euerlasting farewell take : for euer , and for euer , farewell cassius , if we do meete againe , why we shall smile ; if not , why then this parting was well made
cassi .
for euer , and for euer , farewell brutus : if we do meete againe , wee ' l smile indeede ; if not , ' tis true , this parting was well made
bru .
why then leade on .
o that a man might know the end of this dayes businesse , ere it come : but it sufficeth , that the day will end , and then the end is knowne .

come now , keepe thine oath , now be a free - man , and with this good sword that ran through caesars bowels , search this bosome .

hye you messala , and i will seeke for pindarus the while : why did ' st thou send me forth braue cassius ?

did ' st thou not heare their showts ?
alas , thou hast misconstrued euery thing .
but hold thee , take this garland on thy brow , thy brutus bid me giue it thee , and i will do his bidding .

onely i yeeld to dye : there is so much , that thou wilt kill me straight : kill brutus , and be honour ' d in his death
sold .
we must not : a noble prisoner .
enter antony .
2 . sold .
roome hoe : tell antony , brutus is tane
1 . sold .
ile tell thee newes .
heere comes the generall , brutus is tane , brutus is tane my lord
ant .
where is hee ?
luc .
safe antony , brutus is safe enough : i dare assure thee , that no enemy shall euer take aliue the noble brutus : the gods defend him from so great a shame , when you do finde him , or aliue , or dead , he will be found like brutus , like himselfe
ant .
this is not brutus friend , but i assure you , a prize no lesse in worth ; keepe this man safe , giue him all kindnesse .
i had rather haue such men my friends , then enemies .
go on , and see where brutus be aliue or dead , and bring vs word , vnto octauius tent : how euery thing is chanc ' d .
exeunt .
enter brutus , dardanius , clitus , strato , and volumnius .
brut .
come poore remaines of friends , rest on this rocke
clit .
statillius shew ' d the torch - light , but my lord he came not backe : he is or tane , or slaine
brut .
sit thee downe , clitus : slaying is the word , it is a deed in fashion .
hearke thee , clitus
clit .
what i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world
brut .
peace then , no words
clit .
ile rather kill my selfe
brut .
hearke thee , dardanius
dard .
shall i doe such a deed ?
clit .
o dardanius
dard .
o clitus
clit .
what ill request did brutus make to thee ?
dard .
to kill him , clitus : looke he meditates
clit .
now is that noble vessell full of griefe , that it runnes ouer euen at his eyes
brut .
come hither , good volumnius , list a word
volum .
what sayes my lord ?
brut .
why this , volumnius : the ghost of caesar hath appear ' d to me two seuerall times by night : at sardis , once ; and this last night , here in philippi fields : i know my houre is come
volum .
not so , my lord
brut .
nay , i am sure it is , volumnius .
thou seest the world , volumnius , how it goes , our enemies haue beat vs to the pit :
low alarums .
it is more worthy , to leape in our selues , then tarry till they push vs . good volumnius , thou know ' st , that we two went to schoole together : euen for that our loue of old , i prethee hold thou my sword hilts , whilest i runne on it
vol .
that ' s not an office for a friend , my lord .
alarum still .
cly .
fly , flye my lord , there is no tarrying heere
bru .
farewell to you , and you , and volumnius .
strato , thou hast bin all this while asleepe : farewell to thee , to strato , countrymen : my heart doth ioy , that yet in all my life , i found no man , but he was true to me .
i shall haue glory by this loosing day more then octauius , and marke antony , by this vile conquest shall attaine vnto .
so fare you well at once , for brutus tongue hath almost ended his liues history : night hangs vpon mine eyes , my bones would rest , that haue but labour ' d , to attaine this houre .
alarum .
cry within , flye , flye , flye .
cly .
fly my lord , flye
bru .
hence : i will follow : i prythee strato , stay thou by thy lord , thou art a fellow of a good respect : thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it , hold then my sword , and turne away thy face , while i do run vpon it .
wilt thou strato ?
stra .
giue me your hand first .
fare you wel my lord
bru .
farewell good strato .
- caesar , now be still , i kill ' d not thee with halfe so good a will .
dyes .
alarum .
retreat .
enter antony , octauius , messala , lucillius , and the army .
octa .
what man is that ?
messa .
my masters man .
strato , where is thy master ?
stra .
free from the bondage you are in messala , the conquerors can but make a fire of him : for brutus onely ouercame himselfe , and no man else hath honor by his death
lucil .
so brutus should be found .
i thank thee brutus that thou hast prou ' d lucillius saying true , octa .
all that seru ' d brutus , i will entertaine them .
fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
stra .
i , if messala will preferre me to you
octa .
do so , good messala
messa .
how dyed my master strato ?
stra .
i held the sword , and he did run on it
messa .
octauius , then take him to follow thee , that did the latest seruice to my master
ant .
this was the noblest roman of them all : all the conspirators saue onely hee , did that they did , in enuy of great caesar : he , onely in a generall honest thought , and common good to all , made one of them .
his life was gentle , and the elements so mixt in him , that nature might stand vp , and say to all the world ; this was a man
octa .
according to his vertue , let vs vse him withall respect , and rites of buriall .
within my tent his bones to night shall ly , most like a souldier ordered honourably : so call the field to rest , and let ' s away , to part the glories of this happy day .
